I2 Perceptron README
All codes meant to be run with Python 3.6
#########################################
Part 1: run with: python part1.py

part1.py outputs an accuracy vs. iteration plot to fig/part1 for online perceptron results. 
It shows both the training and validation accuracies at each iteration.
A file called 'oplabel.csv' is also output which contains the yest set predictions, one prediction per line, either a -1 or 1

#########################################
Part 2: run with: python part2.py

part2.py outputs an accuracy vs. iteration plot to fig/part2 for average perceptron results. 
It shows both the training and validation accuracies at each iteration.
A file called 'aplabel.csv' is also output which contains the yest set predictions, one prediction per line, either a -1 or 1

#########################################
Part 3: run with: python part3.py

part3.py outputs figures for accuracy vs. iteration plots for each kernel degree, p, to fig/part3 for kernel perceptron results. 
Each accuracy vs. iteration shows both the training and validation accuracies at each iteration.
Also, part3.py outputs a figure in fig/part3 that is a validation accuracy vs. kernel degree plot.
A file called 'kplabel.csv' is also output which contains the yest set predictions, one prediction per line, either a -1 or 1
